## PlantR App Project - React Native
Ever think your green thumb isn't so green? Hate the idea of going away and possibly starving your plants, or if you're like me, you need a reminder to water your plants and even then sometimes forget? Fret no more, we have built an easy to use app to take the guesswork and worry away! 

This was a group project using React Native to automatically water your plants from your phone using a Raspberry Pi, arduinos, water pumps, hoses, a water receptacle, and of course...water and plants to water.  

The project is still being iterated on to add more features and functionalit for the user. 

**Current features:**
* Create an account and register your Raspberry Pi
* Secure login 
* Dashboard where listener is running to pick up newly plugged in devices (Arduinos) to set to your account
* Dashboard to display status of device (Arduinos), if functional, on, or other status (some sensor not working)
* Dashboard to show all devices (Arduinos) and set device details, plant to water, watering schedule, amount of water
* Realtime update to database when editing/adding to schedule, one API call when saving changes
* Easy to use and intuitive! Set it and forget it

**Roadmap:**
* Allow more sensor data reporting (temperature, humidity, moisture, light, water amount)
* More robust statuses
* Ability to see historical data in easy to digest graph format
* Reset password
* Enhanced data reporting

## Sunny Day Growers Web App Project - React
This was a group project to help a local grower in Washington with managing his inventory. He had a website with product information but no live data on what is in stock, and any changes had to be manually entered, he also managed his inventory in an excel spreadsheet.

He wanted us to bring him into the 21st century with an easy to use platform to view his inventory, edit/add/remove products, which then would reflect realtime data to potential buyers on his website. 

The outcome, an easy to use secure platform to the owner to log in, see his inventory, make changes, and have a digestible format for him to work with for his business, click the link below for the deployed project on Heroku.
