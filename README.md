## PlantR App Project - React Native
Ever think your green thumb is brown? Hate the idea of going away and possibly starving your plants, or if you're like me, you need a reminder to water your plants? Fret no more, we have built an easy to use app to take the guesswork and worry away! 

React Native app for automatically watering your plants using Raspberry Pi, arduinos, water pumps, hoses, water receptacle, and of course...water. 

Features: 
* Create an account and register your Raspberry Pi
* Secure login 
* Dashboard where listener is running to pick up newly plugged in devices (Arduinos) to set to your account
* Dashboard to display status of device (Arduinos), if functional, on, or other status (some sensor not working)
* Dashboard to show all devices (Arduinos) and set device details, plant to water, watering schedule, amount of water
* Realtime update to database when editing/adding to schedule, one API call when saving changes
* Easy to use and intuitive! Set it and forget it
