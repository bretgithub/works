## PlantR App Project - React Native, Node, MongoDB
Ever think your green thumb isn't so green? Hate the idea of going away and possibly starving your plants, or if you're like me, you need a reminder to water your plants and even then sometimes forget? Fret no more, we have built an easy to use app to take the guesswork and worry away! 

The project used React Native for the mobile app, Node and MongoDB for the backend and database. For the app and watering system to function the user has a main controller (Raspberry Pi) and a watering devices(Arduino) for each plant to be watered, that syncs with the main controller. 

The project is still being iterated on to add more features and functionality for the user. 

**Current features:**
* Create an account and register your main controller
* Secure login 
* Dashboard where listener is running to pick up newly plugged in watering device for your plant
* Dashboard to display the status of your watering device(s) for each plant
* Screen to edit/add a schedule to your watering device by day of the week, time, and amount to water
* Screen to show the device schedule
* Easy to use and intuitive! Set it and forget it

**Roadmap:**
* Allow more sensor data reporting (temperature, humidity, moisture, light, water amount)
* More robust statuses
* Ability to see historical data in easy to digest graph format
* Reset password
* Enhanced data reporting

## Sunny Day Growers Web App Project - React
This was a group project to help a local grower in Washington with managing his inventory. He had a website with product information but no live data on what is in stock, and any changes had to be manually entered, he also managed his inventory in an excel spreadsheet.

He wanted us to bring him into the 21st century with an easy to use platform to view his inventory, edit/add/remove products, which then would reflect realtime data to potential buyers on his website. 

The outcome, an easy to use secure platform to the owner to log in, see his inventory, make changes, and have a digestible format for him to work with for his business, click the link below for the deployed project on Heroku.

## Memory Game Web App - React
Simple Game of Thrones themed memory game built using React. 

The objective is to click on each of the characters without repeating a selection, if you manage to get through you save Westeros from the Night King, if you don't, then Winter falls the land.

The game is made a bit harder by the shuffling of tiles when you make a selection, the game keeps track of your current score and max score, and automatically resets when you win or lose.
